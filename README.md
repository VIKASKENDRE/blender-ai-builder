ðŸŽ¯ Project Name
Blender AI Builder
Generate 3D scenes in Blender from natural language descriptions using AI.

ðŸ“– Description
Blender AI Builder is an open-source Blender add-on that enables users to generate objects and simple scenes from text prompts, such as:

"Create a room with a desk and a lamp near the window."

The add-on parses natural language using AI models, maps it to procedural modeling functions, and builds the scene within Blender automatically.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Text-based scene generation
âœ… Procedural primitive creation (cube, sphere, cylinder, etc.)
âœ… Modular, extensible codebase
âœ… Integration with NLP models (OpenAI GPT or local alternatives)
âœ… Blender UI panel for prompts and results
