🎯 Project Name
Blender AI Builder
Generate 3D scenes in Blender from natural language descriptions using AI.

📖 Description
Blender AI Builder is an open-source Blender add-on that enables users to generate objects and simple scenes from text prompts, such as:

"Create a room with a desk and a lamp near the window."

The add-on parses natural language using AI models, maps it to procedural modeling functions, and builds the scene within Blender automatically.

🚀 Features
✅ Text-based scene generation
✅ Procedural primitive creation (cube, sphere, cylinder, etc.)
✅ Modular, extensible codebase
✅ Integration with NLP models (OpenAI GPT or local alternatives)
✅ Blender UI panel for prompts and results

🌟 Future Enhancements
Asset library integration (e.g. BlenderKit or Sketchfab)

Contextual placement and spatial reasoning

Object texturing and material generation

Full room layout generation (walls, furniture, decor)

Voice input for commands
